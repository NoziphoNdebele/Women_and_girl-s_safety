Domestic violence remains a critical barrier to achieving gender equality as outlined in UN SDG 5, affecting womenâ€™s physical, mental, and economic well-being. The aim is to explore the socio-economic factors that contribute to domestic violence and develop an AI-powered solution that can help predict and prevent these incidents. By uncovering patterns and correlations through machine learning, this project aims to empower policy-makers, community leaders, and support services to take proactive action against domestic violence.\n\n### Significance\nThrough AI-driven analysis of socio-economic data such as education, employment, income, and marital status, this project seeks to provide data-driven insights that inform strategies to support vulnerable women and mitigate domestic violence. The AI model will help uncover patterns that can be used to design targeted interventions, improving community safety, empowering women, and contributing to broader efforts to promote gender equality.\n\n### Problem Domain\nDomestic violence against women, especially in rural and developing regions, often goes unreported due to economic dependency, cultural barriers, and societal norms. Using machine learning models to analyze the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) 2017, Wave 5 dataset, the project will uncover relationships between key socio-economic variables and domestic violence. The insights gained can be scaled to other similar communities, contributing to global efforts to reduce violence against women and girls.\n\n### Challenges\n* **Data Analysis Complexity:** Identifying the socio-economic factors that contribute to domestic violence requires advanced AI techniques, such as natural language processing, predictive modeling, and classification. Ensuring these models are both accurate and actionable is crucial.\n* **Cultural Sensitivity:** Any AI-driven intervention must be culturally adaptable, addressing local contexts while being scalable across regions.\n* **Actionable Insights:** The solution must translate AI-driven findings into practical recommendations for policy-makers and community leaders, ensuring the impact extends beyond theoretical analysis.\n\n### Key Questions\n* How does education level correlate with the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence?\n* How do employment and income levels influence the risk of domestic violence?\n* Does marital status play a significant role in the incidence of domestic violence?\n* Which age groups are most vulnerable to domestic violence, and how can preventive measures be applied through AI insights?\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n<a href=#one></a>\n## **Importing Packages**\n\n### Purpose\nTo set up the Python environment with the necessary libraries and tools required for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
